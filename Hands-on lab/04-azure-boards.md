# Exercise 3: Azure Boards and Test plans

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you'll explore Azure boards and Azure test plans. Azure Boards provides software development teams with the interactive and customizable tools they need to manage their software projects. Azure Test Plans provides rich and powerful tools everyone in the team can use to drive quality and collaboration throughout the development process. The easy-to-use, browser-based test management solution provides all the capabilities required for planned manual testing.

### Task 1: Connect Azure Board with GitHub

In this task, you will connect your Azure DevOps project's board to your GitHub repository using the Azure Boards app for GitHub to support the integration between Azure Boards and GitHub. This app is free for both public and private repositories. You'll also explore work items. 

1. In your browser open GitHub Marketplace by navigating to the below URL:

    ``` 
    https://github.com/marketplace/azure-boards
    ```

    ![The Azure Boards Integration App on GitHub Marketplace that will provide a link between Azure DevOps Boards and GitHub issues.](media/hol-ex1-task1-step1.png "Azure Boards Integration App on GitHub Marketplace")

1. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select `Install it for Free.`

   ![](media/2dg50.png)
   
1. On the next page, select **Complete order and begin installation**.

1. Select the lab files repository `aiw-devops-with-github-lab-files` which you created earlier and click on **Install & Authorize**.

   >**Note**: If you see the message **Youâ€™ve already purchased this on all of your GitHub accounts** this indicates Azure Boards integration is already used in your account, follow the below steps.
   
   - Scroll to the top of the Azure Boards Marketplace page and select **grant this app access to your GitHub account**.
   
   ![](media/2dg51.png)
   
   - Select the lab files repository `aiw-devops-with-github-lab-files` which you created earlier and click on **Install & Authorize**.

   ![](media/ex4-kc-install&auth.png)
    
1. Select the **aiw-devops** Azure DevOps organization and select the Fabrikam project then click on **Continue**

1. When the integration succeeds, you will be taken to the Azure DevOps Board. In the onboarding tutorial click on **Create** to create an initial Issue in the `To Do` Column.

   ![](media/2dg55.png)
    
1. Now click on **Create and link a pull request** to create a pull request associated with your Issue.

   ![After completion of the onboarding tutorial. Two todo confirmation messages displayed.](media/image15.png "Get started and quick tip")

1. Open the new Issue that the onboarding tutorial creates and observe the GitHub pull request and comments that are linked to the Azure DevOps board Issue.

   ![Linked GitHub items in an Azure DevOps issue in Boards.](media/ex3-t1-8.png "GitHub Pull Request and Comment")

1. In GitHub, browse to the `Pull Requests` tab of the lab files repository created in [Task 1 of the Before the HOL Instructions] and open the pull request that was created in the onboarding tutorial for the Azure Boards Integration App. Note the `AB#1` annotation in the pull request comments - this annotation signals to Azure DevOps that this pull request comment should be linked to Issue #1 in Azure Boards.

   ![Pull request detail in GitHub created by onboarding tutorial in previous steps.](media/ex4-kc-merge.png "Pull Request detail")

1. Select the `Files changed` tab within the pull request detail and observe the change to the README.md associated with this pull request. After reviewing the changes, go back to the `Conversation` tab and select the `Merge pull request` button and confirm the following prompt to merge the pull request into the `main` branch.
